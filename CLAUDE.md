## First Steps

- Immediately read the README.md at the root of this project to understand the codebase.

## Reference Projects

- **EQEmu**: A downloaded copy of the EQEmu server source should exist in an adjacent project directory (sibling to this repo). Use it as reference for quest scripts, spawn data, zone mechanics, and server-side logic.

## Asset Paths

- All original EverQuest client assets (models, textures, zones, sounds, etc.) are located at `/assets/EverQuest`
